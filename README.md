Develop DAX measures, Power Query (M Query) scripts, and optimised data models.

Handle ETL processes and understand data warehouse concepts.

Identify trends, conversions, drop-offs, and performance issues.

Work closely with stakeholders to gather requirements and define KPIs

Communicate insights clearly using strong data storytelling skills.

Focus on accuracy, problem-solving, and attention to detail.
